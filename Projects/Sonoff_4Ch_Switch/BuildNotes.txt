Sonoff inspired, 4Ch Switch using Tasmota Firmware

Notes on implementation

So, configure Tasmota as a HUE Bridge (Multi Device)

Then configure the module as a GENERIC (Type18) module for the Wemos.

Then in the module config, set the following options:

D3 GPIO0: 17 Button1	
TX GPIO1: 00 None	
D4 GPIO2: 18 Button2 	
RX GPIO3: 00 None
D2 GPIO4: 23 Relay3
D1 GPIO5: 22 Relay2 	
D6 GPIO12: 21 Relay1
D7 GPIO13: 00 None
D5 GPIO14: 19 Button3
D8 GPIO15: 24 Relay4
D0 GPIO16: 20 Button4

Thats it, set Alexa to discover it all and bingo!
 	
Adding a DS1820B Onewire connection as well to make the unit versatile......
using GPIO13 on D7 for this..

Hmm, new "issue", if fully configure the above settings, the device will Reset all config to default
and re-boot, many options tried, no effect.
Read about Setoption13, set it "ON", and the device restarted, and has been stable ever since,
BUT, after the reboot, an additional Status message: RSL: Setoption13: OFF
appears, so not sure whats happened, the OFF state is the default state.....
hey ho, whatever fixes the problem....
O.K. so not as straitforward, seems it sets itself OFF again after 25 seconds, setting it again seems to make it permanent...
